# Step-1: Verify if ssh-keys are already set
```
ls ~/.ssh
```

# Step-2: Create a new set of ssh-keys
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email_id@example.com"
```
Note: You can pass any comment for -C argument.

> When prompted 'Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/your-user/.ssh/id_ed25519)'

Press enter/return key to generate keys in your `~/.ssh` directory.

> And for Enter passphrase for "/Users/your-user/.ssh/id_ed25519" (empty for no passphrase)

When you created your SSH key, you were optionally asked to set a passphrase. This is like a password that adds an extra layer of security. It ensures that even if someone gets access to your private key file, they canâ€™t use it unless they also know the passphrase. You can set a passphrase or just press enter/return key.

# Step-3: Verify if ssh-keys were generated successsfully
You should be seeing `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` files in your `~/.ssh` directory.
```
ls ~/.ssh
```
